sinny's nginx unprivileged setup

## prerequisites

- any sh-compatible shell (sh, bash, zsh, fish, etc.)
- git ðŸ“¦
- [podman](https://github.com/containers/podman/) ðŸ“¦ or [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (rootless supported for both)
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) ðŸ“¦
- [docker compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) ðŸ“¦
- a DNS provider capable of DNS-01 challenge (from [this list](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi))

ðŸ“¦ - likely available as a package for your system

## quickstart

0. run `git clone --depth=1 && https://github.com/SinnySupernova/snus.git && cd snus` to clone the repository and cd into it
1. run `make config` to copy the example config to the `config.toml` file
2. open the `config.toml` file and adjust the settings
3. run `make init` to perform the initial setup
4. run `make up` to launch everything

## commands

#### `make init`
runs the setup scripts (update the repos and creates configs for all the tools used)

#### `make up`
##### internally uses `docker compose up -d` with some extra steps

deploys the containers

> [!NOTE]
> first run takes longer because container images are built locally

#### `make stop`
##### internally uses `docker compose stop` with some extra steps

stops the containers

#### `make restart`
##### internally uses `docker compose restart` with some extra steps

restarts the containers

> [!NOTE]
> do not use this after updating the repositories because docker compsoe will restart from the old state, use `make up` instead

#### `make down`
##### internally uses `docker compose down` with some extra steps

destroys the containers

#### `make destroy`
##### internally uses `docker compose down -v` with some extra steps

destroys the containers and the volumes

> [!CAUTION]
> DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION - always backup before using this

#### `make update-nginx`

pulls updates from the [nginx git repo](https://github.com/nginxinc/docker-nginx-unprivileged)

this runs automatically during `make init`

#### `make update-acmed`

pulls updates from the [acmed git repo](https://github.com/breard-r/acmed)

this runs automatically during `make init`

#### update-dockergen

pulls updates from the [dockergen git repo](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/docker-gen)

this runs automatically during `make init`

then source the file or start a new shell and you should be able to run `make` in docker

[this docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/alpine/make) is used
